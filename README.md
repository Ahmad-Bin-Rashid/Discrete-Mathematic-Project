<h1>Discrete Mathematics Project</h1>
<p> This project is designed to test and enhance our understanding of graph
theory and number theory concepts in discrete mathematics, and their applications in
computational contexts, by our dedicated teacher: <b>Waqas Ali</b> <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/waqas-ali-429922261/>(See Profile)</a></p>
